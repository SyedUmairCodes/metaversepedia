## Brief history of the internet

**Web 1.0**: In the early 1990s the internet was starting to increase. More and more common people started using the internet instead of just office workers and military scientists. At that time almost all the content available on the internet was static and couldn't be changed once published.

**Web 2.0:** After a few years in the year 2005 the next generation of the internet was introduced was dubbed web 2.0. This version is the current version of the internet that we use in our daily lives. We can all use the internet today but it is very much controlled by big tech industries like Apple and Google.

**Web 3.0:** In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto created a digital currency called bitcoin and from there on out the era of the decentralized web had begun. Web 3.0 is the latest vision/version of the world wide web and it has a great potential.

## Why does Web3 matter?

Web 3.0 is the new revolution in the programming world by what's wrong with the current web? (Web 2.0) The answer is Trust.

Trust is something that is lacking in our current web services that we use on a daily basis because we don't how BIG TECH companies store our data or what they do we it. (We actually do)

Hackers can steal your data from these service providers or worse they can sell all your personal data to governments, ad marketers, and anyone who pays the right price.

Web 3.0 is a new ray of hope that promises to solve this problem. Every "transaction" in Web 3.0 or the block-chain can be seen by anyone that is on that block-chain. So this removes the factor of what's happening to my data. It also remove almost every single "middleman" that exists in Web 2.0.

## The Blockchain

A block-chain is the building blocks (pun intended) of the Web 3.0. A blockchain consists of multiple blocks and acts like a database that records transactions. Each block has three things inside it:

- It has some data that we have stored in it.

- It has a unique hash value that is used to identify it and the hash value changes every time the data is change.

- The block has the hash value of the previous block that was created before it. This allows the blocks to be chained together hence the name blockchain.

The first block in every block-chain is called the genesis block because it doesn't have any other previous blocks and all other blocks originate from it.

Each block-chain is equally distributed among all of the users and each user has a full copy real-time copy of the whole block-chain.

## Blockchain Consensus

Sometimes a computer may or may not agree to all of the rules that regulate the blockchain and keeping track of all of the members in the blockchain can be a very hard task. The solution to this problem is a distributed consensus.

A consensus is a agreement about the block-chain that is agreed by all of the members. If we add a new block in the block-chain at least 51% of the members will have to agree so that the new block could be added to blockchain.

This rule also applies to previous members. If a previous member acts suspicious or tries to do something malicious and 51% percent of the members agree to ban them they will be banned from the blockchain completely.

## Cryptocurrencies

Crypto currencies are digital currency that any person in the world can use. Normal currency like dollars and yen require a central governing body that regulates these currencies. The governing body applies rules and regulations to these currencies which everyone has to follow.

Since normal currencies are printed on paper and coins they can't be transferred digitally unless you use a third-party service which also takes a minimal service fee for transferring your money.

Crypto currencies on the other don't have any central governing body instead they rely on the rules of the block-chain they are used on. Crypto currencies don't exist on paper they are all digital and that's why we don't need a third-party service to send and receive them.

Just like normal currency, there are many types of crypto currencies available today that have a total market cap of more than that of a country's GDP.

The two most popular crypto currencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum and most other crypto currencies are just copies of these two with more or less features.

## Coins and Tokens

A crypto currency can exist in the form of coins like bitcoin or tokens like thether.

Coins are native to the block-chain that they are created on. Ethereum has a native coin called ether(ETH) and there are many tokens that third-party developers have created on the Ethereum block-chain like tether.

Crypto currencies can also be classified by if they are used for transactions or stored for their value. Bitcoin was originally invented to be used like gold and it's value would grow over time.

Transaction crypto currencies like ripple are used for small transactions because the transaction fee on these block-chains is minimal as that of compared to the Ethereum block-chain. The transaction fee is also called gas in the Ethereum block-chain.

You can further distribute crypto currencies by their ability to be mineable or not.

- Mineable crypto currencies like bitcoin allow users to take ownership of some bitcoins if they contribute to a new node on the block-chain.

- A non- mineable crypto currency is when all of the tokens or coins available on the block-chain is already available to the creator from the start and only they can distribute the coins or tokens to other people.

## Wallets and Adresses

Using multiple addresses for performing transactions in crypto currencies is a common practice.

A single crypto wallet can have multiple addresses and each address can contain small amounts of bitcoin that add up together the total amount of bitcoin you have.

A crypto wallet is like a bank and the addresses are like bank accounts. The developers behind bitcoin encourage users to use a different address each time they make a transaction on the bitcoin block-chain.

This process of having multiple addresses keeps the users details private and also makes the transactions public.

## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Bitcoin introduced an algorithm known as proof of work to conduct the consensus on the blockchain.

This is not a simple task because there are so many people on the block-chain and each person has his own copy of the blockchain.

Proof of work allows the person that wants to update the transactions on the blockchain, he must show his proof of work. When the computer adds blocks on the blockchain it does that by mining more bitcoin.

Proof of work requires you to use your computer to keep guessing the correct hash of the next block on the block-chain and this can become very tedious because every miner is also doing the same thing with their own computers. In the end this becomes a race to see who guesses the most correct hashes and mines the most bitcoin.

The whole bitcoin network mines new blocks at the same time and this consumes a lot of energy. The estimated power usage of just the bitcoin network is estimated around 15 giga watts of power per every 24 hours.

The insane amount of power required to operate a bitcoin mining network and the effect of this on the environment is the main con of blockchain networks.

Each block only needs a single three-digit hash in the bitcoin blockchain but there are so many people mining these hashes that for every single correct hash there are more than a billion rejected hashes that are wasted.

## Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

After the criticism regarding the proof of work technique a new technique called proof of stake is now being introduced in the blockchain world which makes blockchains more compelling.

In proof of stake you manually set aside some amount of bitcoin from your account and get selected randomly based on the amount of bitcoins you've set aside.

If you add an invalid block to the blockchain you will lose the amount of that you staked for mining.

This concept is better than proof of work because you don't need to have multiple computers running all the time to mine bitcoin for you. In proof of stake people that add new blocks to the blockchain are called validators and not miners and this way to add new blocks is better than the proof of work way.

The winner between these two ways to add new blocks is not decided yet because both have their own pros and cons.

## Upgrading the Blockchain

A block-chain is a database of transactions that is distributed to every single person that makes a transaction and since every person has his own copy a consensus is used to make sure that all members have the exact same data.

If someone wanted to take the current state of the blockchain and add or remove features from it and transform into his own version he needs to create a fork of the blockchain.

There are two types of forks a person can make, A soft fork or a hard fork:

- A soft fork is an upgrade is backwards compatible. Meaning that the older version of the blockchain can recognize the new update and the newer version can work seamlessly with the old one. Sometimes the developers will focus on only the new version and only offer limited support for the old version and will request users to migrate to the newer version

- A hard fork is an upgrade that introduces completely new changes that are not backwards compatible and the only option to keep using the software is to upgrade to the newer version because the changes are so different that they cannot be compatible with the older version

## Ethereum

Ethereum is the worlds first programmable blockchain. Bitcoin is only capable of performing transactions and nothing more.

Ethereum is a block-chain that takes the same approach as bitcoin but allows the its crypto currency called ether to be programmable.

A block in the Ethereum blockchain can store more data than a block in the bitcoin blockchain which makes it able store more data than just transactions.

This allows people to make games and apps on the Ethereum blockchain. This code can be executed when a transaction is performed on the block in which the code is present.

All of these advanced transactions on the Ethereum blockchain is not free. All of the transactions performed on the Ethereum blockchain a small amount called gas has to be paid in order to complete the transaction.

## Smart contracts

All accounts on the Ethereum blockchain have the ability to send, receive and hold ether. There are two types of accounts you can create on the Ethereum block-chain:

- One is an externally owned account.

- The second one is a contract account.

Externally owned accounts can only interact with the account balance that is available in the account.

Contract accounts can access all of the properties of the account including balance, storage and the code stored in the account. Contract accounts can access the account without human intervention and sometimes are called smart contracts.

You can create and upload smart contracts on the Ethereum global state and once the contract is saved you can make message calls on the contract. Message calls allows you to access the smart contracts and execute the code stored in them.

Smart contracts can do almost anything that you can program them to do. Some people can also add malicious code in the smart contract but there is a way built into the Ethereum blockchain that mitigates the risk of such a thing happening.

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine

The Ethereum virtual machine is what makes our smart contracts run on the Ethereum network. The computer on the Ethereum network act as a distributed computer for the Ethereum virtual machine to run our smart contracts and also validating new blocks to add them to the block-chain.

The Ethereum client software allows any general purpose computer to be a node on the Ethereum network. As a node your computer can communicate with all the other computers that are available on the Ethereum network There are many Ethereum clients available but the most popular one is called **GO Ethereum**.

When you install a client you'll also have access to the Ethereum virtual machine you can test your smart contracts on your own computer once you have the client installed.

## DApps

Decentralized applications or DApps for short are the programs and code that you write which is executed on the block-chain. We can say that a smart contract is basically a DApp.

When you create a front-end user interface for any of your smart contracts its then called a DApp.

The user-interface is created using web technologies like HTML, CSS. and JavaScript while the logic of the DApp is hosted on the blockchain network.

> Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to read and write data to the Ethereum blockchain using JavaScript.

There are also different types of block-chains that you can host your DApps on like Ethereum and Solana.

> In Ethereum the more complex transaction that is performed by your DApp the more gas fees you'll have to pay for it.

## IPFS

The IPFS or Inter-planetary file system is a distributed file system like blockchains. IPFS uses a peer-to-peer system and uses unique hashes like blockchains for file validation.

IPFS is used to user data in DApps. The data that a user enters into the frontend of the DApp to access the smart contract assigned to it is stored in the IPFS.

If you create a social-network on a block-chain to login details of a users account cannot be stored inside the smart contract or the front-end and that's where IPFS is used to store these types of data.

## The Metaverse

The Metaverse is a term used to describe a virtual reality worlds which you can access them using virtual reality devices.

The main purpose of the metaverse is to remove the boundaries of the real world. We can have office meetings or family gathering while sitting at our homes and it will feel and look like you're all together at the same place.

A lot of people and big corporations are spending a lot of money on this concept and this is can be great news for Web 3.0.

## What is a NFT

An NFT stands for a non-fungible-token. It's a means of proof of ownership of an digital asset. Non fungible means that the token is unique and cannot be duplicated or replaced.

## Fungible Vs Non-fungible

A fungible token or asset is equal to 1:1. A single US dollar is only equal to another US dollar regardless of when it was printed or it's serial number. If the asset can be changed in value and in likeness it is considered fungible. Bitcoin also is an example of a fungible token or asset.

> Examples of non-fungible tokens can be a plane ticket, a watch, and a collection of stamps or figurines.

A Rolex watch is sometime worth millions of dollars no matter how old it is.(Sometimes the older ones cost more.) And a regular watch that you buy from a local store is worth only it's price and it's value will only decrease and not increase as time goes by like the

Rolex. The serial code and model of the Rolex also matters because the more unique the watch will be the more valuable it will be.

Two Rolex watches of the same model, one made in 1950 and one made in 2020 have different values because the older model has a higher value that the community of watch collectors have given it. The value of the asset determines that is it a fungible asset or a non-fungible asset.

## Why should we use NFTs

In the digital world, the ownership of an asset was never clearly defined. When you buy something online you and the people that you tell are the only one who knows that you bought that asset. The public doesn't know.

Ownership of an asset means that you can re-sell it freely. Currently we don't have any standard way to re-sell online assets. What proof do you have publicly that the asset that you claim is actually your?

These are the types of questions and scenarios that NFTs as a technology is trying to solve. Each NFT is a unique online asset that cannot be copied or replaced because the proof of ownership is available publicly online on a de-centralized ledger called the blockchain.

## Blockchain and NFTs

NFTs are a concept of a token that acts like a proof of ownership of an digital asset. In the real world, The concept of NFTs is powered by de-centralized block-chains. The block-chain is the backbone of the NFTs

A block-chain is a type of a database that consists to multiple pieces and copies so that each person that is a member of the block-chain has his own personal copy of the database.

## Interoperable

NFTs have the ability to be exchanged across eco-systems. The actual NFT is just a token. If that token is created on the ethereum block-chain it can be exchanged on any block-chain that is based on the ethereum block-chain and marketplaces.

## Immutable

An NFT should be unique and in-divisible. An asset can have multiple copies of it on the block-chain but each individual unit has a unique serial number or code that makes it different from others.

They make look the same but in reality they are all unique. Block-chains records data in a way that makes it very hard for us to change it.

## Trading

An NFT can be freely traded on any compatible marketplace or block-chain. An NFT can be traded across ecosystems, for example if I have an asset on the ethereum blockchain and want to trade it for another asset on a block-chain that is compatible with ethereum I can easily trade it.

## Liquidity

Liquidity means that I can sell my NFts on marketplaces that will give me cash or bitcoin or ethereum instead of another digital asset of the same value.

## Programability

NFTs also need to support the ability to hold code inside of them. We can program NFTs that will allow us to execute certain tasks at a certain period of time.

## NFT Standards

### ERC-721

ERC-721 is the first standard for NFTs on ethereum. Its like a template for building smart contracts on the ethereum network. It provides all of the guidelines that you need to create your NFTs. This standard creates and keeps track of ownership of NFTs.

### ERC-1155

The last standard on the ethereum network is called ERC-1155. This standard is like an enhancement to the ERC-721 standard.

ERC-1155 is an super-set of the ERC-721 standard because it can hold classes and is a lot cheaper. You can also trade in bulk and also create ERC-721 tokens in an ERC-1155 token.
